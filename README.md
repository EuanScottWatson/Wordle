# Wordle
## Running
To run:
```
python .\wordle.py -pro -guess
```

Use the `-pro` flag if you want to use all 12,972 possible 5 letter words. Omit this flag to use Worlde's actual wordlist which is only 2,315 words long. <br>
You can use the `-guess` flag if you are wanting to enter in an actual Wordle's guesses and get feedback. In that case, type in the 5 letter word guess, then use one of three:
* 0 = Incorrect letter
* 1 = Wrongly placed letter
* 2 = Correct letter <br>

Then press enter to submit the data.
